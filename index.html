      Shinra Kusakabe is a third generation pyrokinetic youth who gained the
      nickname "Devil's Footprints" for his ability to ignite his feet at will,
      and was ostracized as a child for the fire that killed his mother and
      younger brother Sho twelve years ago. He joins Special Fire Force Company
      8, which features other pyrokinetics who dedicated themselves to ending
      the Infernal attacks for good while investigating Companies 1 through 7
      for potential corruption in their ranks. Shinra begins to learn that the
      fire that killed his mother was a cover for Sho to be taken by the White
      Clad, a doomsday cult behind the Infernal attacks with agents within the
      facets of the Tokyo Empire. Company 8 and their allies oppose the White
      Clad while learning of their goal to gather eight individuals like Shinra
      and Sho to repeat the Great Cataclysm for an ancient being who manipulated
      humanity for that very purpose.
